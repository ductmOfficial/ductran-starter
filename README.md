[![CI](https://github.com/ductmOfficial/ductran-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ductmOfficial/ductran-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A TypeScript monorepo template for my portfolio projects. Every project starts from the same foundation: strict TypeScript, shared lint and format configs, component tests, CI on every pull request, a local PostgreSQL, and enforced commit conventions.

## What's inside

| Area        | Tools                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Monorepo    | [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) workspaces, [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com)               |
| Language    | TypeScript 6 (strict), Node.js 24 LTS                                                |
| Lint/format | ESLint 10 (flat config, type-aware `typescript-eslint`, `@eslint-react`), Prettier 3 |
| Testing     | Vitest 5, jsdom, Testing Library, jest-dom, user-event, v8 coverage                  |
| UI sample   | React 19 component library (`@repo/ui`) built with `tsc`                             |
| Database    | PostgreSQL 18 via Docker Compose                                                     |
| CI          | GitHub Actions, protected `main` branch (ruleset)                                    |
| Conventions | Conventional Commits (commitlint + husky), PR template, issue forms                  |

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 (`.nvmrc`; run `nvm use` or `fnm use`)
- pnpm 12 (`npm install -g pnpm`; the exact version is pinned in `packageManager`)
- Docker with Compose v2 (only for the database)

`pnpm install` fails on a different Node major because `engineStrict` is enabled.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ductmOfficial/ductran-starter.git
cd ductran-starter
pnpm install          # also installs the git hooks

pnpm build            # build all packages
pnpm test             # run all tests
```

Local database (optional):

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # optional: compose.yaml has the same defaults
pnpm db:up            # start PostgreSQL and wait until it is healthy
pnpm db:psql          # open psql inside the container
```

Connection string: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/app` (development only).

## Scripts

Run from the repository root.

| Script               | What it does                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm build`         | Build every package (`turbo run build`)                          |
| `pnpm lint`          | ESLint in every package; warnings fail the run                   |
| `pnpm typecheck`     | `tsc --noEmit` in every package                                  |
| `pnpm test`          | Vitest in every package                                          |
| `pnpm test:coverage` | Tests with coverage; HTML report in `packages/*/coverage/`       |
| `pnpm format`        | Format the whole repo with Prettier                              |
| `pnpm format:check`  | Check formatting without writing (used by CI)                    |
| `pnpm db:up`         | Start PostgreSQL in the background and wait until it is healthy  |
| `pnpm db:down`       | Stop PostgreSQL, keep the data                                   |
| `pnpm db:reset`      | Stop PostgreSQL and delete all data                              |
| `pnpm db:logs`       | Follow the PostgreSQL logs                                       |
| `pnpm db:psql`       | Open `psql` in the container; extra arguments are passed through |

Run a script in one package with a filter, e.g. `pnpm --filter @repo/ui test:watch`.

## How it works

**Task pipeline.** Each package defines its own `build`, `lint`, `typecheck` and `test` scripts. Root scripts call `turbo run <task>`, which runs them in dependency order (`^build` means "build my dependencies first"), in parallel where possible, and caches results by content hash. A second run with no changes finishes in milliseconds (`FULL TURBO`).

**Shared configuration.** TypeScript, ESLint and Prettier configs live in `packages/*-config` and are consumed with `workspace:*`. A new package only needs a two-line `eslint.config.js` and a `tsconfig.json` that `extends` a shared preset.

**Internal packages are built.** `@repo/ui` compiles to `dist/` with type declarations, and its `exports` point there. `tsconfig.json` (editor and typecheck) includes tests; `tsconfig.build.json` excludes them from the output.

**Tests.** Vitest runs in jsdom. Component tests use Testing Library queries by role and `user-event`, so they check behavior the way a user sees it. Globals are off: test functions are imported explicitly and `vitest.setup.ts` calls `cleanup()`.

**CI.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs with a frozen lockfile, lints commit messages and the PR title, checks formatting, then runs `turbo run lint typecheck test build`. The pnpm store and the Turbo cache are cached between runs. Actions are pinned to commit SHAs and the token is read-only.

**Protected `main`.** The ruleset in `.github/rulesets/protect-main.json` requires a pull request, a passing `Verify` check, an up-to-date branch and linear history, and blocks force pushes and deletion. Merge with **rebase** (keeps focused commits) or **squash** (one commit from the PR title).

## Contributing workflow

1. Branch from `main`: `git switch -c feat/short-description`
2. Commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org): `type(scope): summary`, e.g. `feat(ui): add Card component`. The `commit-msg` hook rejects anything else.
3. Push and open a PR: `gh pr create`
4. Wait for the `Verify` check: `gh pr checks --watch`
5. Merge: `gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch`

## Using this template for a new project

1. Create the repository: `gh repo create <name> --template ductmOfficial/ductran-starter --public --clone`
2. Rename the project: `name` in the root `package.json`, `name` in `compose.yaml`, and this README.
3. Install and verify: `pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm test`
4. Protect `main` (rulesets are not copied by templates):
   ```bash
   gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<name>/rulesets --input .github/rulesets/protect-main.json
   gh repo edit --enable-merge-commit=false --delete-branch-on-merge
   ```
5. Keep or remove the sample `packages/ui`, and add apps under `apps/`.
